# Firmware Downloader for DCS-932L

This repository contains a Python script that automates the downloading and extracting of firmware for the DCS-932L camera model. It downloads the firmware from a specified URL, unzips the content, and extracts the default username and password from the configuration files.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need `requests` for HTTP operations and `os` for operating system interface. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd yourrepository
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python download_firmware.py
```

The script performs the following operations:
- Downloads the firmware zip file from the provided URL.
- Unzips the firmware file into the current directory.
- Parses the configuration file to find the default username and password.
- Saves these credentials into a text file named `novieind.txt`.

## Output
